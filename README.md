# Arduino-Projects

In the winter of 2016, I took my first Computer Engineering class, Engineering Practice (ECE160). In this class, we used Arduino code to light LEDs, make buzzers go off, and make motors spin.

The the Mini Projects Description zip contains the description for each mini project I completed. The other zip file contains the code i used to complete each task. If you have an Arduino board, feel free to wire everything up and watch it all work!
